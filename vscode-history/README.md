## Features

- Show the history of VSCode activities.
  - Clicking on a menu item launches a VSCode window based on its history.
- Pin the history item to the xbar menu.
  - The pinned entries are stored separately from the VSCode history.
  - You can edit the appearance of the pinned entries (including order, icon, label text, destination file/folder/workspace/uri).

## Install

Install [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar). Then install the plugin script:
```sh
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzmish/xbar-plugins/main/vscode-history/vscode-history-plugin.py
$ chmod +x vscode-history-plugin.py

### Supported URI types

Each VSCode window has a unique identifier called the Folder URI. The activity history is stored with this URI, and can be called from the command line as `code --folder-uri <uri>` to open the specified VSCode window. The following table shows the URI formats currently recognized by this plugin:

|&nbsp;&nbsp;Icon&nbsp;&nbsp;|Type|Scheme|Details|
|:--:|----|------|-------|
|üíª|Local|`file://...`|The entry type corresponds to a local file or directory.
|üêã|Container|`vscode-remote://attached-container+...`|This entry type corresponds to a VSCode session attached to a Docker container using the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.|
|üì¶|DevContainer|`vscode-remote://dev-container+...`|This entry type corresponds to a [DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) session using the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.|
|üîå|SSH|`vscode-remote://ssh-remote+...`|This entry type corresponds to a VSCode session connected to an external server using the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension.|
|üêãüîå|Container over SSH|`vscode-remote://attached-container+{settings.host: "ssh://..."}...`|This entry type corresponds to a VSCode session attached to a Docker container running on a server connected via SSH.|
|üì¶üîå|DevContainer over SSH|`vscode-remote://dev-container+{settings.host: "ssh://..."}...`|This entry type corresponds to a DevContainer session running on a server connected via SSH.|

This interpretation is performed by the `create_entry_from_uri` function.

### Entry types

The following types of history entries stored in VSCDB are supported by this plugin:

|Icon|Type|Details|
|:--:|----|-------|
|üìÑ|File|This type of history entry has the `fileUri` property. If you open VSCode using this kind of URI, no directories will be opened.|
|üìÇ|Folder|This type of history entry has the `folderUri` property. If you open VSCode using this kind of URI, the corresponding directory will be opened.|
|üè¢|Workspace|This type of history entry has the `workspace` property, and the sub-property `configPath` contains the path to the workspace configuration file (`.code-workspace`). If you open VSCode using this kind of URI, the corresponding workspace will be opened.|

This interpretation is performed by the `load_vsc_history` function.
